You must use the HTML body container code provided (you are not allowed to modify it). To support the HTML body container code, you must include a style container. Your style container must:
- Implement an appropriate type selector rule that would apply to all possible heading elements (not just the ones shown).
- Implement appropriate class selector rules with bold and strike-through selectors.
- Implement an appropriate type.class selector rule for `p` elements that use a
gray-background selector.
- Implement a type selector rule for all p elements. The rule should specify:
  - A 5-pixel padding
  - 50-pixel left and right margins
  - A dashed red border
  - Times New Roman or serif font text that is justified with both the left and right sides
  - 10-pixel indentation

The window background must render using the color cyan. The top heading must render using the color blue. For the sake of getting practice with different color value formats, you must use different techniques to specify each of the three color messages:
- silver—use an HSL value
- fuchsia—use a hexadecimal RGB value
- bright orange—use an integer RGB value
